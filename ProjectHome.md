BlazingStars is an attempt to provide an OS X alternative to Windows AutoHotKey programs that interface with online poker clients like PokerStars.  The program is a menu-bar application that gives you the ability to select hotkeys that will perform chores in the PokerStars client like pressing the Fold, Bet, and Call buttons, incrementing the bet size, and pot-sized betting.

The code is written entirely in Objective-C and Cocoa.  Image manipulation and screen scraping are done with ImageMagick and the Tesseract-OCR engine, which are both open-source projects.

If you would like to download and test the most bleeding edge version of BlazingStars, take a look at the DebugBuilds page.

NOTE: BlazingStars is currently on a development hiatus.  This is because I do not currently have the time to maintain it, and no-one has stepped forward to help me continue development.  Development may resume in the future, though I cannot be sure when.  I think you for your support of the project;  if anyone would like to take over active development or be a part of it, please contact me.
