# Introduction #

What follows is my (SH) thoughts on the milestones for the 1.0 and beyond release(s) of BlazingStars, with features and development goals for each. This list is by no means the final word, and I welcome discussion about what should be on it.


# Details #

## v 0.9.8b ##

I hope to have major coding tasks finished for this release;  that includes all new features before we hit 1.0.

### Features ###

  * Auto time bank
  * PFR +xBB / limper.
  * Mouse button mapping to hotkeys (not convinced on this one).
  * ???

### Non-coding tasks ###

  * ??

## v 0.9.9b ##

I'm seeing this as a catch-up release,  letting us finish important non-coding tasks for 1.0.

### Features ###

None. We should be feature-complete here.

### Non-coding tasks ###

  * Documentation -  need docs for the features implemented since I open sourced the project.
  * Theme support. I'd like to get at least a few more themes in place for the 1.0 release.
  * ???

## v1.0.0 ##

I'm seeing this as an opportunity to bugfix as we go from 0.9.9 to 1.0.0. No new features or theme support should be added here,  just testing and fixing to make 1.0 as stable and robust as possible.

## Beyond 1.0 ##

This will require some thought and discussion. I'm seeing this going one of two ways:

  1. We make a new list of most-requested features,  implement the top x items off the list, and then add Full Tilt support.
  1. We add Full Tilt support first, and then add features in parallel for both versions.

The second way would probably bring more users and support to the project, but adds developmental complexity. I'm open to thoughts in both regards.
