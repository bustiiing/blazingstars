*Important*:  _Right now, the most recent build is the one on the home page (0.9.8b-21).  The debug page will be updated and this notice removed when I have a fresher debug release.  Thank you!_

If you'd like to test the cutting edge features of BlazingStars, you can download a copy of the latest debug build of BlazingStars (or at least, the latest debug build that *I* have) here at http://fullyfunctionalsoftware.com/blazingstars/debug/BlazingStars.zip

Note:  If you already have BlazingStars installed, I would recommend downloading BlazingStars to a directory other than the Applications directory (or whereever the version you already have is installed).  This will avoid any conflicts with Sparkle auto-updating of the application when I release a new official build.
